ScribexX - Writing App Specification Sheet

Overview
ScribexX is a writing app designed for junior high students and surrounding grades. It balances
direct instruction for excellence with creative freedom , empowering students to express
their ideas and improve their writing skills. The app is heavily inspired by gamification and
interactive learning , incorporating engaging aesthetics, intuitive UI, and AI-assisted feedback.

Core Features
1. Two-Pronged Approach to Writing Instruction
A. Reflective Exercise on Direct Instruction (REDI)
● Focuses on the analytical side of writing.
● Presents structured lessons and exercises.
● Lessons are categorized under three layers of writing instruction (Mechanics,
Sequencing, and Voice).
● Students complete exercises and must reach 90% accuracy to proceed.
● Failure conditions exist to encourage retrying with minimal frustration.
● AI-generated levels ensure a vast pool of content.
B. Open World Learning (OWL)
● Inspired by sandbox-style games and Codecademy’s self-driven learning.
● Encourages real-world writing applications (e.g., journalism, persuasive essays,
screenplays, product descriptions, etc.).
● AI reviews writing in real-time , giving structured feedback.
● Students choose topics of interest while maintaining assigned genre variety.
● A "Writer’s Block" button suggests new ideas when students are stuck.

2. Three-Layer Writing Instruction Model
Mechanics & Grammar : Covers spelling, sentence structure, and syntax to build
automaticity.
Sequencing & Logic : Focuses on argument structure, logical flow, and content
generation.
Voice & Rhetoric : Covers audience awareness, word choice, rhythm, and persuasive
techniques.
3. UI/UX and Gamification
A. Home Screen & Navigation
● The home screen resembles a mobile game level map.
● A seasonal theme refreshes the map’s aesthetic every few months.
● Bottom navigation bar includes:
○ Map Button (Home Screen - level progression)
○ Writing Page Button (Access OWL projects)
○ Creative Tool Button (Inspiration & writer’s block assistance)
○ Leaderboard Button (Competitive rankings)
○ Profile Button (User profile, teacher/parent settings)
● Navigation is enabled via swipe gestures and button selection.
B. Gamified Learning Experience
● Skill-based progression (Mechanics, Sequencing, and Voice levels unlock
sequentially).
● Levels require mastery (90%+ completion) to proceed.
● Adaptive difficulty : Mechanics levels become less frequent as proficiency improves.
● Leaderboards :
○ Students compete within classroom bubbles or through direct one-on-one
challenges.
○ AI can score writing exercises within the same genre for fair competition.

4. AI Integration
● AI provides immediate and objective feedback for both REDI (structured exercises)
and OWL (free writing projects).
● AI assists with real-time feedback on structure, grammar, and clarity.
● No AI-generated content for writing; only feedback-based AI to ensure students
genuinely develop their skills.
● A "Writer’s Block" button suggests prompts for students who need inspiration.
Design & Aesthetic Guidelines
1. Theme & Mood
● Synthwave + Cyberpunk + Botanical Futurism
● Bright neon colors combined with metallic grays and sleek whites.
● A balance between visually engaging design and a distraction-free writing space.
● The digital void aesthetic conveys the idea of infinite possibility and creative power.
● UI should feel minimalist, smooth, and glassy with organic elements to ground it.
2. Inspiration & Conceptual Approach
● Language is as powerful as coding , and the app should convey this visually.
● Writing is about creating the future , not just following rules.
● The interface should communicate a sense of limitless potential and mastery.
Technical Requirements
1. Platform & Compatibility
● Mobile-first design (iOS & Android compatibility required).
● Cloud-based storage for user progress and writing projects.
● Offline mode for writing practice with auto-sync upon reconnection.
2. AI & Backend
● Natural Language Processing (NLP) for AI feedback on writing quality.
● Progress tracking : Adaptive learning based on student performance.
● Secure student data storage , compliant with COPPA and FERPA regulations.
3. User Profiles & Permissions
● Student accounts with progress tracking.
● Teacher/parent accounts with classroom management features.
● Customizable controls for difficulty, AI interaction, and content selection.
Next Steps
