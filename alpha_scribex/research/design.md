## 6. Interaction Design
- **Micro-Interactions:**  
  - Subtle animations when buttons are pressed, transitions occur, or new content loads.
  - Feedback (visual and/or haptic) should be immediate to confirm user actions.
  
- **Gestures:**  
  - Support common mobile gestures (swipe, tap, pinch) with intuitive responses.
  - Ensure that interactions remain smooth and do not overwhelm the user.

- **Encouragement Through Design:**  
  - Positive reinforcements like subtle congratulatory messages or visual indicators when tasks are completed.
  - Use progressive disclosure to gently introduce more advanced features as the user grows familiar with the app.

  - Design interactive elements with ample touch targets for users with motor challenges.

- **Inclusivity:**  
  - Utilize inclusive language and imagery that reflects a diverse user base.
  - Provide clear instructions and visual cues for all interactions.
